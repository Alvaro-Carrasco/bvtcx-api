##     AVAYA IP TELEPHONE CONFIGURATION FILE TEMPLATE
##                ***  04 SEP 2016  ***
##
## This file is intended to be used as a template for configuring Avaya IP telephones.
## Parameters supported by software releases up through the following are included:
##
##      96x1  SIP  R7.1.1.0
##      96x0  SIP  R2.6.14.5
##
######################################################################################
##
## Any line that does not begin with "SET ", "IF ", "GOTO ", "# " or "GET " is treated as a comment.
## To activate a setting, remove the "## " from the beginning of the line for that parameter so
## that the line begins with "SET ", and change the value to one appropriate for your environment.
##
## To include spaces in a value, the entire value must be enclosed in double quotes, as in:                                               
## SET MYCERTCN "Avaya telephone with MAC address $MACADDR"
##
######################################################################################
##
## List of MODEL4 values for models which support MODEL4 as testable parameter in the 
## configuration file (for example: IF $MODEL4 SEQ 1603 GOTO SETTINGS16XX).
## 9608
## 9611 
## 9621
## 9641

######################################################################################
##
##                     COMMON SETTINGS
##
## Settings in this section will be processed by all telephones,
## but not all parameters are supported by all telephones or all software releases.
## Settings for parameters that are not supported will be ignored.
## For more information, see the Administrator's Guide available at support.avaya.com
##
###############  LAYER 2 VLAN AND QOS SETTINGS  ##############
##
## L2Q specifies whether layer 2 frames generated by the telephone will have IEEE 802.1Q tags.
##  Value  Operation
##    0    Auto - frames will be tagged if the value of L2QVLAN is non-zero (default).
##    1    On - frames will always be tagged.
##    2    Off - frames will never be tagged.
##  Note: This parameter may also be set via DHCP or LLDP.
##  This parameter is supported by:
##       H1xx  SIP  R1.0 and later, Note: Value 1 has the same behavior as value 0.
##       96x1 H.323 R6.0 and later
##       96x1  SIP  R6.0 and later
##	 B189 H.323 R1.0 and later

##       16CC  SIP  R1.0 and later
##       1603  SIP  R1.0 and later
## SET L2Q 0
##
## L2QVLAN specifies the voice VLAN ID to be used by IP telephones.
##  Valid values are 0 through 4094; the default value is 0.
##  Note: This parameter may also be set via DHCP or LLDP.
##  This parameter is supported by:
##       H1xx  SIP  R1.0 and later
##       96x1 H.323 R6.0 and later

##       16CC  SIP  R1.0 and later
##       1603  SIP  R1.0 and later
## SET L2QVLAN 5
##
## L2QAUD specifies the layer 2 priority value for audio frames generated by the telephone.
##  Valid values are 0 through 7; the default value is 6.
##  Note: This parameter may also be set via LLDP and H.323 signaling,
##         which would overwrite any value set in this file.
##  This parameter is supported by:
##	 H1xx  SIP  R1.0 and later
##       96x1 H.323 R6.0 and later
##       96x1  SIP  R6.0 and later

##       16CC  SIP  R1.0 and later
##       1603  SIP  R1.0 and later
## SET L2QAUD 7
##
## L2QVID specifies the layer 2 priority value for video frames generated by the telephone.
##  Valid values are 0 through 7; the default value is 5.
##  This parameter is supported by:
##	 H1xx  SIP  R1.0 and later
## SET L2QVID 7
##
## L2QSIG specifies the layer 2 priority value for signaling frames generated by the telephone.
##  Valid values are 0 through 7; the default value is 6.
##  Note: This parameter may also be set via LLDP or H.323 signaling,
##         which would overwrite any value set in this file.
##  This parameter is supported by:
##	 H1xx  SIP  R1.0 and later
##       96x1 H.323 R6.0 and later
##       96x1  SIP  R6.0 and later

##       16CC  SIP  R1.0 and later
##       1603  SIP  R1.0 and later
## SET L2QSIG 7
## 
## VLANSEP specifies whether VLAN separation will be enabled by the built-in Ethernet switch
##  while the telephone is tagging frames with a non-zero VLAN ID. When VLAN separation is enabled,
##  only frames with a VLAN ID that is the same as the VLAN ID being used by the telephone
##  (as well as priority-tagged and untagged frames) will be forwarded to the telephone.
##  Also, if the value of PHY2VLAN (see below) is non-zero, only frames with a VLAN ID that is
##  the same as the value of PHY2VLAN (as well as priority-tagged and untagged frames) will be
##  forwarded to the secondary (PHY2) Ethernet interface, and tagged frames received on the
##  secondary Ethernet interface will have their VLAN ID changed to the value of PHY2VLAN and
##  their priority value changed to the value of PHY2PRIO (see below).
##  Value  Operation
##    0    Disabled.
##    1    Enabled if L2Q, L2QVLAN and PHY2VLAN are set appropriately (default).
##  This parameter is supported by:
##       96x1 H.323 R6.0 and later

################  CAPTIVE PORTAL SETTINGS  ##############
##
## CAPTIVE_PORTAL_SERVER specifies the URL of the captive portal server. 
## Android supports a detection mechanism of whether the device is behind captive portal which requires HTTP authentication 
## in order to access the Internet. The mechanism is based on sending HTTP requests to http://clients3.google.com/generate_204. 
## If HTTP response 204 is returned with null content then the device assumes that it is correctly connected to the Internet, 
## else captive portal is assumed. There may be customers who block access to the Internet (or to certain Internet pages) 
## and for these customers the detection mechanism will notice that the device is not connected to the Internet and raise notification. 
## For these customers, the CAPTIVE_PORTAL_SERVER parameter shall be configured to “” (default). “” (null string) implies that the detection mechanism is disabled. 
## There may be other customers that want to have their own captive portal server. These customers can configure their own HTTP server. 
## As long their HTTP server does NOT return 204 with null content then the device will assume it behind captive portal 
## and redirect the user to the relevant HTTP authentication page. As the default of CAPTIVE_PORTAL_SERVER is null, 
## then customers may need to do staging of the device and set CAPTIVE_PORTAL_SERVER to the relevant captive portal server 
## in the settings file before deploying the device in the field (mainly for cases where captive portal prevent download of 
## configuration files in the field) OR configure CAPTIVE_PORTAL_SERVER in the local DHCP server deployed in the field.
## Captive portal is supported over both Wi-Fi and Ethernet interfaces. 
##  Zero or one URL in the following format: 
##  [http://]hostname[:port][/path]
